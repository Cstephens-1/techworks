        <p id="description">Travel Exchange was founded to foster connections between people around the world. Most of
            those lucky enough to travel internationally for pleasure only get a taste of their destination's culture.
            Travel Exchange provides a way to immerse yourself completely. Choose your destination and when you want to
            get there, match with one of our verified exchange-mates, and spend time getting to know each other. You and
            your
            exchange-mate will live for up to a month in the other's home, getting to know their family and friends,
            their local foods and places to hang out, and truly see how the day-to-day goes in another country.
